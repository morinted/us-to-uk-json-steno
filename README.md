# Make Plover UK

- Input: a JSON steno dictionary with US spelling.
- Output: a JSON steno dictionary composed of the differences with UK spelling, plus some edge cases (UK uses both check and cheque, draft and draught.)

## Run

1. Get Node JS
2. Clone and `cd` into the repo.
3. `npm install && npm start`
4. Dictionary will be generated against `main.json` in the repo. No arguments because I'm a little lazy.
